# Technicolor TC7230 exploit

This exploit uses the [Cable Haunt vulnerability](https://cablehaunt.com) to pop a shell externally for the Technicolor TC7230 (EB.01.25-160301-F-5FF) cable modem. A similar, but only local, exploit exists for [Sagemcom F@st 3890](https://github.com/Lyrebirds/sagemcom-fast-3890-exploit).

A list of known vulnerable modems can be found on https://cablehaunt.com/#faq-am-i-affected.

There are two ways of exploiting the modem in this repo.

## Direct Spectrum Analyzer javascript request
### How it works
This exploit uses the same principle as [the Sagemcom F@st 3890 exploit](https://github.com/Lyrebirds/sagemcom-fast-3890-exploit).
The biggest difference is that the attack webserver can be hosted externally.
The exploit.py serves a website, that when visited by any computer on a local network with the modem, sends a malicious WebSocket request to the cable modem.
The request overflows the return address, and accompanying registers, in the spectrum analyzer of the cable modem and using a ROP-chain starts a reverse shell to an external IP.
The ROP-chain is constructed and commented in static/exploitTechnicolor.js, where the IP address used can be changed on line 100. 
The exploit.py server then sends the exploit.raw file over this TCP connection which will then be executed by the modem.
The exploit.raw file is reverseshell.c compiled to MIPS architecture (see below how).
Reverseshell.c is shellcode written explicitly for this modem. The shell listens for commands to be run in the eCos shell on the cable modem and redirect STDOUT to the TCP connection.

## Running the exploit

**Note: Windows 10 is not currently supported, you must use a Linux based OS**

Install pwntools and flask for python3 and run `python exploit.py`.
Now go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser, to exploit the modem.
Firefox will not work for this, as the WebSocket version used is not compatible.

Now an interactive shell should pop in your terminal running the python script.
If you exit the shell, the modem needs to be rebooted to start a new shell.

## Building your own payload

If you want to compile your own payload you can grab the toolchain from [aeolus](https://github.com/Broadcom/aeolus) and run the following command:

```
/<toolchain Path>/gnutools/mipsisa32-elf/bin/mipsisa32-elf-gcc -O3 -c ./reverseshell.c -o ./reverseshell.o && /<toolchain Path>/toolchains/gnutools/mipsisa32-elf/bin/mipsisa32-elf-objcopy -O binary reverseshell.o exploit.raw
```

## Building exploit for another cable modem

You can build and exploit any modem vulnerable to Cable Haunt using this technique.
We recommend reading the [techincal report](https://github.com/Lyrebirds/Cable-Haunt-Report/releases/latest/download/report.pdf) before trying to write your own ROP-chain.
Go to [Cable Haunt](https://cablehaunt.com) for a list of known vulnerable cable modems.

### Building the ROP chain

First, you will need the firmware for the cable modem you're going to exploit.
Then, reverse engineer the firmware to find the addresses of the relevant function for building the exploit such as socket(), bind(), accept(), listen(), recv() and connect() for a shell.
Then [Ropper](https://github.com/sashs/Ropper) can be used to find gadgets using the following command:

```
python Ropper.py --type all --all --badbytes 00c0c1f5f6f7f8f9fafbfcfdfeff2c -r -a MIPSBE -I 0x80004000 --console -f <firmware path>
```

### Unreachable gadgets

Not all gadgets can be reached, as gadgets are just addresses sent as raw bytes and not all bytes can be sent as a WebSocket request with text frames.
For instance, the address 0x8080a864 can not directly be inserted in a WebSocket text frame as it is not a valid UTF-8 character, but 0xf28080a864 can as 0xf2 means start new UTF-8 symbol with 0x8080a864 as the trailing bytes. 
The following bytes cannot be present in any address used because of the utf-8 specification: 0x00, 0xc0,0xc1,0xf5, 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xf8, 0xf9, 0xfa, 0xfb, 0xfc, 0xfd, 0xfe, 0xff, 0x2c. Other restrictions also exists which will soon be explained further in our report.
For now, you can read and use `utf8TestScript.py` to test if an address if reachable.

### Custom payload

You can use the process described above to compile your own payload for new cable modem but remember that the payload must not return! If it returns, the process will look for a return address on the smashed stack and crash.
## Residental gateway/DNS Rebind
### How it works
The second attack indirectly attacks the cable modem through its Residental gateway and uses this as another unit on the network. This is the attack registrered as [CVE-2019-19495](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2019-19495). The attack uses DNS Rebind to gain access to the web configuration of the tc7230. Using access to this web it sets up port forwarding for the telnet server running on the linux side of TC7230, and from there sends a Cable Haunt exploit package to gain full control og the Cable Modem.

### Running the exploit
To run this exploit install the required dependencies for running DNS.py and run it with sudo to serve on port tcp 80 and udp 53. This will serve a malicious webserver on port 80 and DNS server on udo port 53. Now to simulate owning the domain pwnmymodem.com we change the primary DNS server of the victims machine to the attackers ip. Remember to change the ip in DNS.py accordingly.

Now when the victim enters http://pwnmymodem.com the exploit will tricker after some time (around 2 minutes),
as the DNS cache of the victims browser has to be cleared before the exploit will execute. 

## Extracting firmware from Cable Modems

For most modems, you will need a way to access the eCos shell to extract the firmware or extracting it directly from the flash chip.
These firmwares are usually packed in a format called [ProgramStore](https://github.com/jclehner/bcm2-utils/blob/master/FIRMWARE.md)
If the serial console is not working try running: (might only work if coax cable is disconnected or not provisioned)
```
snmpset -v2c -c private 192.168.0.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.4413.2.2.2.1.9.1.2.1.0 i 2
snmpset -v2c -c private 192.168.0.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.4413.2.2.2.1.9.1.2.1.0 i 0
snmpset -v2c -c private 192.168.0.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.4413.2.2.2.1.9.1.2.1.0 i 2
```
Then the shell should be accessible, and [bcm2-utils]( [https://github.com/jclehner/bcm2-utils) can make it easy to extract it using this shell.
When reversing the extracted firmware the load/base address is (as far as we have seen) always 0x80004000.
